# SNAPWF (SNAP Automated Python Workflow)
## Usage
This workflow can generate PSI and SBAS interferometric time series for full Sentinel-1 scenes by using the available open-source tools ASF-Search and SNAP-ESA, which are integrated into Python-based codes to perform the processing chain from dealing with the raw Sentinel-1 data until generating the time series interferometric stacks.
